        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Guiso de lentejas is a hearty, warm stew made of lentils, onion, bell peppers and garlic, with a lot of spices. It is perfect for winter.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 medium onions.</li>
            <li>5 garlic cloves.</li>
            <li>3 bell peppers, a red, a green and a yellow one.</li>
            <li>1 big potato.</li>
            <li>1 big piece of pumpkin (similar in weight to the potato).</li>
            <li>1 big yam (similar in size to the potato, as well).</li>
            <li>3 medium carrots</li>
            <li>800g of lentils.</li>
            <li>Spices of choice.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Leave the lentils submerged in water for 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Chop the peppers, the onion and the garlic cloves. Chop the as finely as you like.</li>
            <li>Cut the potato, the pumpkin and the yam in small cubes.</li>
            <li>Put the chopped onions, peppers and garlic cloves in a no-stick (ideally) pot with oil and cook them as much as you like.</li>
            <li>Once they veggies are cooked add the lentils and water. The stew will cook around two hours. Add more water as necessary to keep it from drying up (the idea is that it should remain liquid but not like a soup).</li>
            <li>When one hour of cooking is left add the potato, the pumpkin and yam cubes. Stir every five minutes.</li>
            <li>Add salt and spices to your liking. I love adding sriracha or some spicy sauce as well.</li>
            <li>Once the two hours have passed check to see if it still has too much water, if it does let it cook some more so it evaporates a bit.</li>
            <li>Let it cool down for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Eat!</li>
        </ol>
