        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A perfect, not too sweet, chocolate milk to drink in the afternoon,</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>10ml of cream.</li>
            <li>290ml of 3% milk.</li>
            <li>8g of chocolate powder (I use nesquick).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Add 10ml of cream to a glass.</li>
            <li>Add 290ml of 3% milk to the glass.</li>

            <li>Add 8g of chocolate powder.</li>
            <li>Mix as much as you like (I usually prefer to mix so that some of the power is still undissolved in the surface of the milk).</li>
