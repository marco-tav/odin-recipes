        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tiramisu is an italian recipe made of ladyfingers and a mix made of cream, eggs, mascarpone cheese, coffee and some other ingredients.</p>
        <p>Tiramisu has a sweet flavor with hints of coffee and is very soft in the mouth.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 eggs.</li>
            <li>500g of mascarpone cheese.</li>
            <li>250g of cream.</li>
            <li>Coffee.</li>
            <li>Coffe liquour.</li>
            <li>Around 50 ladyfingers.</li>
            <li>100g of sugar.</li>
            <li>25g of black chocolate.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the egg whites and the yolks in separate bowls.</li>
            <li>Beat the egg yolks with 100g of sugar until the mix is clearer, nearly white in color.</li>
            <li>Make whipped cream with the cream (with no added sugar).</li>
            <li>Add the whipped cream, the yolks and sugar mix, and the mascarpone cheese and mix them until the resulting mix is homogenous. Add a small quantity of liquor to that mix.</li>
            <li>Beat the egg whites until stiff.</li>
            <li>Add together the stiff whites and the mascarpone mix and mix them carefully to form a foamy mix.</li>
            <li>Make about a liter of coffee and add some liquour to it.</li>
            <li>Carfully submerge, one at a time, the ladyfingers in the coffe and lay them in an flat container until they form a 'floor'.</li>
            <li>Add a cape of foam to cover the ladyfingers floor.</li>
            <li>Add another cape of wet ladyfingers and cover it with foam again. The goal is to have two layers of ladyfingers and a final covering of foam (as shown in the picture).</li>
            <li>Let it cool down in the oven at least 3 hours.</li>
            <li>Finley grate the cheese and spread it evenly on the tiramisu.</li>
            <li>Eat!</li>
        </ol>
